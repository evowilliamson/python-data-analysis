# Python data analysis

This repository contains a set of Python files, collected during my last assignment at a customer's site in the semiconductor industry. Specifics regarding the functional aspect cannot be disclosed.

Notwithstanding, it contains data processing modules (With pandas and numpy) that I implemented after collection requirements from data scientists and physicists who were responsible for the maintenance of involved machines. Also, some extensive use was made of unittest.mock for testing internals of some complex functions.
